To book drugs (listed in the inventory of a consortium of pharmacies) through a smartphone is currently an issue in the e-commerce and pharmacy business. This problem also includes that an app will be able to manage geographic information that allows the location of nearest pharmacies to the current location of the user. In addition, when the client runs the app from a mobile device (smartphone, tablet, etc.), he  will be allowed accessing to the drug catalogue through a browser with a description of the drugs in stock.

Problem setting:

Complete development of an app in Java/Android or C++/IOS (client part), which allows app users to search a drug in the disclosed catalogue of a consortium of pharmacies. The application will easily integrate with standard geographical location applications (e.g.: Google Maps). 

Finally, a version of the app as a Web application that will allow the pharmacy or an authorized dealer to access the pharmaceutical products catalogue and to download the app from the Web site will be implemented.
